# Premise of the Paper Deep-Learning-Models-on-Credit-Card-Fraud-detection

Since credit card fraud is a serious danger to both
consumers and financial institutions, reliable and effective fraud
detection systems must be developed. This paper offers detailed
research on efficiency-driven machine learning models for credit
card fraud detection, with the goal of exploring and optimizing
their performance. To assess the efficacy of several deep learning
architectures in identifying fraudulent transactions, we compare
different classification models and their hybrid equivalents. Our
study uses a broad dataset that includes both legitimate and
fraudulent credit card transactions, which makes it easier to
evaluate the modelâ€™s performance realistically. Our goal is to
maximize the effectiveness of these models by resolving issues
with uneven class distribution, interpretability, and computing
capacity. We describe the findings of our comparative analysis
and optimization strategy, which highlight the advantages and
disadvantages of several machine learning models in situations
involving credit card fraud detection. The significance of effective
and precise fraud detection systems in the quickly changing field
of financial security is emphasized by discussing the consequences
of our findings for practical implementations
